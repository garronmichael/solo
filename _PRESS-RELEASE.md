There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.

  test: your life, your health, your test

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.

  test benefits anyone who is sexually active by creating accountability and awareness about sexually transmitted diseases. 

## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.

  test complies your most recent STD-related test results, vaccinations and medications privately and securely. Your private profile can then be shared or hidden at your discretion with your doctor and/or romantic partners at their request. test eliminates awkward conversations and promotes health education.  

## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.

  The Center of Disease Control estimates that 34% percent of Americans are currently infected with an STD (2013). Additionally, the CDC estimates 20 million new individual infections annually (2013). 

## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.

  test helps you navigate this world by arming you with the information you need to make the choices that are right for you. Request to view the profile of a potential partner and make an informed decision. No need to guess. Just ask to see the test. 

## Quote from You ##
  > A quote from a spokesperson in your company.
  
  "test makes sexual health accessible. Never before has such a simple product made such a profound impact."

## How to Get Started ##
  > Describe how easy it is to get started.

  To get started, sign up at your next clinic visit. Your medical institution will create your profile with your next test results. Your profile will be hidden by default and must be explicity shared with another user. The username and password assigned at sign up will allow you to access and manage your profile. 

## Customer Quote ##
  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.
  
  "I remember those awkward conversations. Now I just ask for the test."

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next.

  When it comes to your health, why rely on anything but the facts? Sign up at your next test. Visit our FAQ's or fill out our contact form if you would like to learn more.
